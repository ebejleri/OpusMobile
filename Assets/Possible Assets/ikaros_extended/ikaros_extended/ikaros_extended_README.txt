Notes:

ikaros is one of my all time most favorite works on OpenGameArt.org,
and for the OGA's Summer 2018 Game Jam I plan to use it to finally
bring to life the game ikaros inspired in me all the way back when surt 
first published it on OGA in 2015.
So here is my attempt to expand the sprite sheet by adding various 
animations and poses that will be required to use it in a full game.
The 16x16 tilesheet is just because I prefer to program in 16x16 worlds, even though
some magic was definitely lost packing the tiles from the original 8x8s.

Currently, there's more scratch and rough work in the sheets than I'd 
normally include in an OGA submission.  For example, there are multiple
variations on the player windup and swing animation, that's because I had
a few ideas for how to handle the animation but won't know which works best
until I start actually making the game.
  
I promise to go back and update everything as I finish it.  Releasing now
to be fair to others who might want to use the sprites for their
OGA's Summer 2018 Game Jam entries.

Sheets are:
player character (walk, jump, climb, crouch, hit, stone, plus windup/swing variations, and misc recolors and female prototype)
skeleton (walk, windup/swing/throw, hit, dead)
medusa (idle, walk, windup & shoot eye beams, hit, plus two walk/attack with bow variations, two die/dead variations, plust two recolors and an 'evil eye' variation)
tiles (surt's original 8x8 tiles packed into 16x6 tiles)
